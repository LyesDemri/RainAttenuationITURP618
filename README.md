# RainAttenuationITURP618

These MATLAB programs calculate the attenuation due to rain based on Recommendation ITU-R P. 618. The main program is "implementationUITRP618.m". 
ituRP838.m and ituRP839.m are used to compute k, alpha, and the rain height, based on the polarisation ("V","H", "linear" or "circular"), elevation angle, 
longitude and latitude of the ground station, and frequency of the transmitted signal.

conversionDonnees839.m is used to convert data from the text file provided with ITU-R P. 839 to a Matlab .mat file. It needs to be executed once before using ituRP839.m
because ituRP839.m uses file "h0.mat" which is generated by this program.

Ap.m defines a simulink S-function to incorporate this calculation in a user defined simulink block
